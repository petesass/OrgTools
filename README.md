-----------------------------------------

Run the .py files in anaconda3 by: ```python file/path/*script.py*```

Scripts:

*```filetypeScrubber.py```*

Will prompt the user to choose a directory, search for filetypes, return a text file with a list of filetypes, ask for exclusions, ask for subdirectory max depth, and finally output to a new folder in the directory filetypeScrubber.

*```Merger.py```*

Will prompt the user to choose a directory and merge all files in all subfolders into a new folder Merger, then ask the user if they want to delete empty filetypeScrubber folders.

FUN STUFF

*```youtubeGet.py```*

Will prompt the user for a youtube URL to download from and then produces a .mp3 file, placing it in a new folder youtubeGet in users\user\documents\youtubeGet.
